# ⚠️ DV Report — `tb_int` MuSiP SWB/OPQ integration

**DUT:** `swb_block` (`ingress_egress_adaptor` → Qsys-generated native-SV OPQ merge → `musip_mux_4_1` → `musip_event_builder`)
**Date:** `2026-04-22`
**Branch:** `yifeng-ip_sim-2604`

This page is the chief-architect dashboard. All per-case evidence lives under [`REPORT/`](REPORT/README.md).

## Signoff Scope

## Non-Claims

- External upstream `packet_scheduler` `signoff_4lane` alignment remains informational and is not part of the musip-local signoff gate in this repo.
- The catalog is structurally complete, but only the promoted anchor cases currently carry isolated rerun evidence; the remaining pages are explicit implemented placeholders.
